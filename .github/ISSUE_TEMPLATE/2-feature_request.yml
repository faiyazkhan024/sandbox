        ## Feature Request Submission

        Thank you for taking the time to contribute by suggesting a new feature or enhancement! Please ensure you have checked for existing feature requests before submitting a new one, as consolidating requests can help us prioritize and track improvements more efficiently.

        **Before Submitting:**
        - Search through [existing feature requests] to see if a similar request already exists.
        - If you find one that aligns with your suggestion, consider adding a comment or your input to that request instead of opening a new one.
        - Be clear and concise about the feature you're proposing to ensure it aligns with the project's goals and can be discussed effectively.

        **Important Notes:**
        - Provide as much detail as possible about the feature, including the problem it solves and the potential use cases.
        - Feel free to attach images or screenshots for clarity where applicable.
        - Make sure to describe alternative approaches or related suggestions if relevant.
