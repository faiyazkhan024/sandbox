# Sandbox

**Sandbox** is a curated collection of diverse programming projects I’ve developed while exploring new languages, frameworks, tools, and concepts. The repository is structured to demonstrate a variety of skills, from solving coding challenges to implementing tutorials and building fun, small-scale projects.

Each project exists in its own isolated environment by using **orphan branches**, ensuring a clean and organized structure. This setup highlights my ability to work with different technologies and approaches without interference between projects.

**Note:** This repository is intended for personal use and is not open for external contributions.

## Overview

This repository serves as a **sandbox** where I experiment with and practice various programming techniques, frameworks, and technologies. It contains:

- **Assignments** from recruiters or coding challenges
- **Courses/Tutorials** that I've followed to learn new skills
- **Fun projects** built for personal enjoyment or experimentation

Each sub-project is kept isolated in its own **orphan branch**, ensuring complete independence between the different topics and projects.

## Why Sandbox?

The **Sandbox** repository serves as my personal coding playground, created to:

- Explore new programming languages and libraries.
- Complete coding assignments and tutorials.
- Create and iterate on experimental projects in a structured way.
- Showcase my ability to handle different programming challenges independently.

This repository acts as a **public portfolio** of my learning journey and coding experiments.

## Usage

Each sub-project resides in its own orphan branch. To explore and use a specific project:

1. **List all available branches**:

   ```bash
   git branch -r
   ```

   This command will show you a list of all available sub-projects as branches.

2. **Checkout a specific project branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```

3. **Follow the instructions** provided in the sub-project's `README.md` for details on how to set it up or run it.

## Project Structure

Each orphan branch contains a project with its own structure. A typical sub-project includes:

- **src/** – The source code for the project.
- **tests/** – Unit or integration tests, if applicable.
- **docs/** – Optional documentation or extra files related to the project.
- **README.md** – Documentation specific to that project, including setup, usage, and objectives.

No sub-project shares history or dependencies with another, ensuring a clean and isolated environment for each.
