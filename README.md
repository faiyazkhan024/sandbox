### 4th

Letâ€™s say we want to print numbers from 0 - 4 we can use for loop to print all of them! But we want them to print with a delay of n seconds where n is the current iteration for example in 1st iteration the delay is 0 seconds and in 2nd itâ€™s 1 seconds and in 3rd itâ€™s 2 seconds and so on..
The following code doesnâ€™t seem to work as expected, please find the bug and help fix it with a brief explanation

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, i * 1000);
}
```
